# Smartian Codebase Overview

Use this map to understand what each top-level folder or file is for.

- **README.md** – original upstream description of Smartian plus basic build and usage instructions.
- **RUNNING_SMARTIAN_MAC.md** – Mac-specific setup and how-to guide we prepared (install steps, sample commands, logging helper).
- **CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md** – this document.
- **global.json** – pins the .NET SDK version (8.x) so `dotnet` uses a compatible toolchain.
- **Makefile / Smartian.sln** – entry points for building everything (`make` wraps `dotnet build -c Release`, the solution groups all projects for IDE users).
- **build/** – output directory generated by `make`; contains compiled DLLs (Smartian, EVMAnalysis, Nethermind libraries).
- **src/** – the Smartian fuzzer itself (F# code for seed generation, grey-box guidance, fuzz/replay commands).
- **EVMAnalysis/** – static analyzer that Smartian runs to reason about contract data flow; includes the `B2R2` disassembly framework as a submodule.
- **nethermind/** – forked Nethermind EVM engine plus supporting libraries; Smartian embeds this to execute transactions during fuzzing.
- **examples/** – ready-to-run sample contracts:
  - `sol/` Solidity sources,
  - `bc/` compiled bytecode,
  - `abi/` ABI specs,
  - helper scripts (`run.sh`, `replay.sh`) for paper artifacts.
- **scripts/** – utility scripts; currently houses `gelo_run.sh` for logging every fuzz/replay run.
- **gelo-run/** – automatically created when using `gelo_run.sh`; stores timestamped logs and `RUN_SUMMARY.md`.
- **LICENSE.md** – project license.

Typical workflow: read `RUNNING_SMARTIAN_MAC.md`, build via `make`, fuzz bytecode/ABI targets from `examples/` (or your own) with `dotnet build/Smartian.dll fuzz ...`, and check `gelo-run/` + `examples/output/<contract>` for recorded findings.
